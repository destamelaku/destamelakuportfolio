### About Me 
Hello! I am currently an undergraduate student at Loyola University of Maryland majoring in Sociology.  

 

With skills in communication, data analysis, and research, I am able to apply my skills of analysis and knowledge of different backgrounds and to achieve accurate assessments of a variety of situations. I am adept at using Microsoft 365, Python, SPSS, Ecosystem, and Excel.  

 

My growing skill set, commitment to my work, and passion for improvement as valuable assets.  In my spare time, I like to draw and crochet.  
 
You can find me on linkedin @ Desta Melaku.
